## For Developers

### How to Use EcoAPI in Your Plugin

To access the EcoAPI in your plugin, use the following:

```php
use didntpott\EcoAPI\EcoAPI;

// Get the economy instance
$economy = EcoAPI::getInstance()->getEconomy();
```

### Basic Examples

```php
// Get player balance
$balance = EcoAPI::getInstance()->getEconomy()->getBalance($player);

// Format currency for display
$formattedBalance = EcoAPI::getInstance()->getEconomy()->formatCurrency($balance);

// Add money to player
EcoAPI::getInstance()->getEconomy()->addBalance($player, 100.0);

// Remove money from player (returns false if player doesn't have enough)
$success = EcoAPI::getInstance()->getEconomy()->reduceBalance($player, 50.0);

// Transfer money between players
$success = EcoAPI::getInstance()->getEconomy()->transferBalance($sender, $receiver, 100.0);

// Working with tokens
$tokens = EcoAPI::getInstance()->getEconomy()->getTokens($player);
EcoAPI::getInstance()->getEconomy()->addTokens($player, 5.0);

// Working with multipliers
$multiplier = EcoAPI::getInstance()->getEconomy()->getMultiplier($player);
EcoAPI::getInstance()->getEconomy()->setMultiplier($player, 1.5);
```

### Check If Player Has Enough Money

public function hasEnoughMoney(Player $player, float $amount): bool {
    return EcoAPI::getInstance()->getEconomy()->getBalance($player) >= $amount;
}
